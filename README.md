# American-employment-discrimination
Although under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employment discrimination is not overt, race-based and sex-based discrimination privately exists in the U.S. workplace, and it has been pervasive for a long time. The minorities and women receive unfair evaluation and disparate treatment so that they face higher unemployment rates, lower earnings with the same performance and fewer opportunities to be promoted to managerial or corporate positions. To quantify and present employment discrimination would be key for public policy makers to understand how the allocation mechanism operates. Through the raw data, this thesis aims to use Python to analyze the data of employment status and visualize the differences between race, sex and age. The raw data collected by the Census Bureau includes the following demographics: population over 16, labor force, not in labor force, employed and unemployed persons, employment and unemployment rate etc. and is divided by race, gender and age from 1948 to 2017.
